	<h1>What are Thrombocytes</h1>
</font>

<p>Platelets are bits of cell broken off larger cells.</p>

<p>Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. If one of your blood vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals to the platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of damage. they form a plug (clot) to fix the damage.</p>

<p>Platelets produce tiny fibrinogen fibres to form a net. This net traps other blood cells to form a blood clot.</p>

<p>The process of spreading across the surface of a damaged blood vessel to stop bleeding is called adhesion. This is because when platelets get to the site of the injury, they grow sticky tentacles that help them stick (adhere) to one another. They also send out chemical signals to attract more platelets. The additional platelets pile onto the clot in a process called aggregation.</p>

		<td>One drop of your blood contains as many as 1,500,000-4,000,000 platelets.</td>

		<td>While plasma can be frozen and stored for up to two years, platelets have a limited shelf life of seven days so they pose more of a challenge to maintain a steady supply.</td>
